equipment or software not supplied by us (including Open Source
Components) where the Software would not itself be infringing; (C)
use of the Software in an application or environment not described in
the Documentation; (D) software or technology not developed by us;
(E) Software that has been altered or modified in any way by anyone
other than us or our authorized agents; (F) your continued use of the
